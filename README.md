# Python Password Strength Checker

This project entails creating a simple password strength checker using Python.

## Overview

I began with creating the main function of the project, "password_checker".

```
def password_checker(password):
    length = False
    letters = False
    numbers = False
    symbols = False
```

The four variables are the basis for the scoring system to be implemented later. In the future, I would like to add more complexity to them.
